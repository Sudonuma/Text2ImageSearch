ent OP lee Dy,

Every Fox has a cozy den for 5. You can stretch out in its fully
reclining bucket seats, sink into its rich, velour upholstery and thick, pile
carpeting. Yet for all its luxuries, the EPA estimated that the Fox got an economical 37 mode
on the highway, 24 in the city, with standard shift (your actual mpg
may vary with how and where you drive, your car's condition and optional extras).
Luxury and economy in one carâ€”you can't get foxier than that.
