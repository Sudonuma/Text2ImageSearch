AND
B@T BIACK.

And a pack of other equally foxy colors. Our crafty little sedan is not
only quick (0 to 50 in 10 seconds), but nimble (sports car type steering
and suspension). It's surefooted (front-wheel drive). Stops straight in its

tracks (special brakingâ€” steering
systems). And has a small
appetite (23 miles per
gallon). Catch one for
